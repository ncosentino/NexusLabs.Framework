# .NET Error Handling — Result Pattern

- **Never throw exceptions unless you intend the application to terminate on the spot.** Throwing
  is reserved for unrecoverable programming errors (e.g. invalid configuration at startup), not
  runtime failures.
- Instead, use a **result pattern**: return successful state, or otherwise an error. The standard
  result types are `TriedEx<T>`, `TriedNullEx<T?>`, and `Exception?`, produced via the
  `Try.GetAsync` / `Try.Get` helpers (available in `NexusLabs.Framework`, or your codebase may
  have its own).
- Exception objects are acceptable error result types when **not** crossing a serialization
  boundary.
- Validation failures are **not** exceptions — use result-based validation patterns.

## Expected parser and validator outcomes

- Invalid, incomplete, unsupported, no-match, and budget-exceeded outcomes are normal control flow.
  Represent them explicitly with `Try` methods, typed results, nullable/boolean state, or terminal
  dispositions.
- Do not deliberately throw and catch an exception to move between expected parser or validator
  branches.
- When a framework parsing API reports malformed input only by throwing, catch it at the narrow
  conversion boundary and translate it into the project's explicit result shape.
